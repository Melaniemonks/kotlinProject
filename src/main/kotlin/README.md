# Kotlin Language

This shows a basic program of how the kotlin language works. Each section is meant to illustrate
codes that teaches the implementation the Kotlin language. The software is set up to interact 
the user using variable, functions, input etc to lead the user to a mad lib game.

My purpose for writing this software was to get a basic fundamental of the language.
